                    <h3>New album "The Bounded World" out April 30th, tour forthcoming</h3>

                    <h5>03/07/2025</h5>

                    <p>Exciting news, little blind cave salamanders! We have a new album coming out on Wednesday, April 30th,
                        in the year of our lord 2025. We've been working on this for ALMOST A YEAR. That's the power of DIY
                        rock music, with which you too can try to balance producing a full-length record and playing shows
                        whenever possible with working a full-time job. It's magical!</p>

                        <!-- <img src="images/tbw/bounded-world-cover-bw-1000.jpg"
                        alt="Cover art for the Bad Optics record The Bounded World"
                        style="max-width:200px; width:100%;" /> -->

                    <p>Not to bury the lead there, but it is indeed a full-length (read: long play) album. Enrobed with the
                        moniker <em>THE BOUNDED WORLD</em>, this stereophonic recording contains 12 songs of pure maximalist
                        bliss. We've been writing it since sometime around early 2023, so you know it's just been stewin' and
                        marinatin' and a-quiverin' with flavor. There are several differences you may notice from our previous
                        releases, the main one being the overwhelming cacophony of synthesizers. Don't worry, this is completely
                        intentional - we did not fall asleep atop a Moog in the studio, nor are we getting into the dreaded idea
                        of creating "soundscapes". You'll still find ear-piercing, heavy guitars accompanied by a man nervously shouting
                        at you, so don't worry. You may also notice that this record contains MORE melodies, MORE vocal harmonies, and
                        MORE unnecessary chord changes. Get ready for fun.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inspired by millenarian cults, "rationalist" tech freaks, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, and
                        mid-century furniture, the album paints an uneasy picture of a world filled with more problems than
                        solutions. Should we all give up and start sacrificing ourselves to the Kinich Ahau, the Mayan sun
                        god? Bad Optics says, unequivocally, yes. Start building those ziggurats.</p>

                    <p>The first single from the album is called <em>Falling from High Places</em>, which will be out on March 
                        21st along with a music video. We'll also be announcing West Coast tour dates for early May soon, as
                        well as a release show in Seattle once we're back. Clamp your eyelids open, A Clockwork
                        Orange-style, and check back soon for that info.</p>
