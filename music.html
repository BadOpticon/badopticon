                                It would be over in an instant if I felt that way<br />
                                I've waited long to commiserate<br />

                                There's a light outside the window overtaking the man<br />
                                Mobius on the periphery points to where it began<br />
                                A good idea left out too long will start to decay<br />
                                You can cloak all of your feelings in a shroud of disarray<br />
                                Dreams are wounds the body sheds<br />

                                I've heard a lot, and I just don't think they hold their weight<br />
                                I've seen the righteous and the grifters as they propagate<br />
                                If it works for you, and you're not hurting other people<br />
                                then that's fine, and I hope you think of me as equal<br />
                                I can't find my way into belief in a holy presence<br />
                                I think my idea of hell might be your idea of heaven<br />
                                But there is one thing in the world that I know to be true:<br />
                                Death is waiting for you and there's not a thing to do<br />

                                Splitting hairs like the splitting of an ocean<br />
                                Another hour and it'll all be gone<br />
                                Greyed out skies just to string you along<br />
                                I am the dust that I will likely choke on</p>
                                
                            <p>My feet are lead and my ears are filled with concrete<br />
                                I'll bite my tongue and move out to the country<br />
                                I'll beg the question and you'll bend the truth<br />
                                You're moving on up now, but what's the use?<br />
                                What's next depends on where you're looking</p>

                                Another prophet, another arrogant death<br />
                                She just got off the phone and there's nothing left<br />

                                who lives inside your bones?<br />
